        <p> "From a young age I began to develop a strong and deep connection with the ocean as a surfer. It wasn't long before it became part of my routine.
        </p>
        <p> Inspired by my father, a mechanic by trade, I also developed an ingenious sense of manual and functional labour.
        </p>
        <p> At the age of 26 I started building my first surf rack, which would later lead to my first project Yourack's - my first company. Fast forward a few years and I have decided to have another business: CNC Machining.
        </p>
        <p> I currently live my life divided between the search for perfection at sea and on dry land.
        </p>
        <p> That's how I'm living my dream so far!"
